## Hello!

We're currently working on a game and created this org so we can keep track of progress and assets. 
it has no release date yet, it doesn't even have a name, but it definitely will have a early access phase and will be free-to-play.

The main dev of the game is [poison](https://github.com/2x10) and is getting help from [gco](https://github.com/gcoX3-boop), [noctirn](https://www.instagram.com/schoreae/) and [amnesia](https://github.com/cherrynervosa) for assets and sprites.
