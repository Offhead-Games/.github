## Hello!

We're currently working on a game and created this org so we can keep track of progress and assets. 
it has no release date yet, it doesn't even have a name, but it definitely will have a early access phase and the game being free-to-play.

The main dev of the game is [poison](https://github.com/2x10) and is getting help from [gco](https://github.com/gcoX3-boop), [noctirn](https://www.instagram.com/schoreae/), [kxu](https://www.instagram.com/xo.kxu/) and [amnesia](https://github.com/cherrynervosa) for assets and sprites.

This is Lucille, the main character of our game. Thanks to gco, we have actual artwork for the game. 

The game is heavily inspired by games such as [Yume Nikki](https://github.com/ynoproject/) and [LSD Dream Emulator](https://lsdrevamped.net/).
